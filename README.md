Ice Touch is ZeroC's implementation of Ice for iOS devices and OS X,
with full support for developpment in the Objective-C and C++
programming languages using the Xcode developpment environment.

With Ice Touch, you can easily build distributed applications, with
apps running on iOS that communicate with each other and with Ice
servers running on OS X, Windows or Linux. You can implement these
servers in any of the languages supported by Ice (C++, Java, C#,
Python, Objective-C).

Ice and Ice Touch allow you to focus your efforts on your application
logic by taking care of all interactions with low-level network
programming interfaces. With these toolkits, there is no need to worry
about details such as opening network connections, serializing and
deserializing data for network transmission, or retrying failed
connection attempts (to name but a few of dozens of such low-level
details).

Ice Touch provides development kits and run times for iOS devices, the
iOS simulator and OS X.

Like Ice, Ice Touch is available under the terms and conditions of the
GNU General Public License v2 (see the ICE_LICENSE file). Commercial
licenses are available for customers who wish to use Ice Touch in
proprietary products. Please contact sales@zeroc.com for more
